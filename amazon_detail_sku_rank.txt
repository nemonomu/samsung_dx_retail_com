detailed_review_content 같은 경우에는 지금 수집된거 중에 하나를 예를 들면 ["This tv is great. For the price it doesn’t get much better. Clear picture, great vivid color, sturdy footings, and good built in speaker quality. The app setups are quick and easy. All around reliable and great brand name behind it.", "Lotsa gr8 things 2 say about this TV. Amazing picture quality, super easy to setup and use, and my favorite feature . . .  Audio is fantastic!! It sounds like an audio system is hooked up to it. Enthusiastic 5 🌟!!", "Excellent Tv. I wanted a Smart TV for my screened porch as I was tired of hooking up my computer to a monitor there with all the wires and speakers etc. This was inexpensive and it's functioning great. Now, all I have to do is get me a glass of wine, give the pets their food and turn on the TV and relax! This was a no brainer and I'm ashamed of myself for not doing this sooner. I did buy a center stand for this to sit on a small table instead of having to have a huge table to fit the legs and take up space, this was the stand: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075TZV6K2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1", "Reaction time is a little slow/ remote lag but otherwise a decent bedroom tv (rarely used). The internet browser function is HORRIBLE but we don't use it often. It wont link for casting for some reason but should, not a deal breaker. Sound and picture are as expected. If you want a basic tv for a low price,  this is probably a good option.  If you want top of the line features, it may not be your best option.", "I bought 2 TVs when they were $125/each for my kid's bedrooms. They are perfect for them. My only complaint is the lag time. There's definitely a delay between when you hit a button on the remote to when it shows on the screen. Not every time, but its inconsistent and annoying. If it was my tv I wouldn't like it, but my kids could care less. The tv picture is beautiful and theres no issue of sound. I also wall mounted them and the tvs are very light.", "We wanted a TV for our small Sunroom. I didn’t want something too big and saw this Toshiba 32” Fire TV which was the perfect size. I liked that it was wireless and 1080p. It was easy to set up and connect to our internet. The picture quality is fantastic and the streaming capability through the internet works well. I was able to load my DirecTV Streaming App on it and it works great! The sound quality was better than expected for a TV of this size. And the remote has voice control and works great with Alexa through my Echo 8. The best part, I was able to get this on sale for under 100 bucks! For the quality and price, I highly recommend it!", "I wanted to like this TV. The picture looks good, and I can access many over-the-air channels with an indoor antenna as well as the streaming platforms I use. However, when I go back and forth between streaming and antenna channels, the volume drops out and I have to unplug the TV and plug back in again several times to get it to work properly.Toshiba customer service is unusable - I don't have time to figure out how to make a copy of an online invoice and whatever other documents they wanted before they would even talk to me. I orginally put in a review complaining about the problem and someone from Amazon called me because it's a FireTV and I guess they didn't want a one-star review on a FireTV product. The woman promised to call me back but never did. I tried again to go through Amazon and spent a half hour texting with 5 (!) Customer Service Reps before they pushed me back to Toshiba. Ain't nobody got time for that. I'm thoroughly disgusted with Amazon and Toshiba customer service and being unable to fix this issue.Apart from the lack of customer service, the interface is also annoying. I don't want to see a commercial every time I turn on the TV yet it takes up the majority of the screen, and there is a small button you can use to get to your antenna channels and change inputs. It's an unfriendly TV and I will never, ever buy a Toshiba or FireTV again.", "This 32\" Toshiba model would be an excellent purchase at any price, but for under $100, it is a steal. It took me longer to remove this television from the excellent packaging than it did to complete set-up. It is a Fire tv, so after set-up, it immediately goes to the familiar Fire home page, but you can select the input to use your cable box, DVD player, etc.The 32\" size is perfect for my bedroom. It fits my armoire perfectly, but if you have a huge room, you might want to go up a size.The picture quality is 1080p, I believe, although other reviewers have said otherwise. The picture is bright and sharp at factory settings, and the included remote is easy to use. I haven't tried adjusting the color, tint, contrast, etc, but it looks to be fairy simple. One thing I did notice, however, is that there does not seem to be a means to change the aspect ratio. For instance, the older shows on the retro stations, ie. MeTV, Antenna TV, are presented in a format that fills the screen from top to bottom but has black bars on each side. It is sort of like watching an older 19\" tv. When commercials come on, or one of the newer old shows like Mash, come on, the whole screen is filled. This does not happen with my 55\" LG 4k in the living room. With that one, the remote allows you to fill the whole screen, but not with this Toshiba. It us not that important to me, but it is worth mentioning if it matters to you.All-in-all, this is an excellent tv for an excellent price. I highly recommend it.Revised 12/11/2024I wish I could give this TV more stars. I am extremely pleased with it. The picture is clear and bright, nearly as good as my 4k UHD LG. Get this, you will not be disappointed.", "This TV was honestly a lot better than I expected. I didn't realize I was able to play a bunch of games on it, even with the remote. And I downloaded a few of my childhood games. I would recommend if you want a smart Tv in between 20-28 inches. And would probably work nice in bedrooms", "I am very happy with the Toshiba 32\" Smart Fire TV!  It's a totally different experience as I learn about the incredible features that's included.  I chose the Toshiba brand on purpose because I still have an older model that's still working after 30 years which is unbelievable.  Having it delivered by FedEx was disappointing and frustrating.", "This tv is great. For the price it doesn’t get much better.
